# OSVM
Register and Stack based VM library for rust

Mainly intended for programming languages \
but can be used for many other thing i guess

## NOTE
##### if you are including an osvm lib file, it is recommended that
##### you set OSVM_LIBS_DIR environment variable to the lib file
##### location in osvm-lib, in the future this will be automated
##### if not set but for now it will do.
